# Geoloader

Geoloader is a little gem that automates the process of loading [GeoTIFFs][geotiff] and [Shapfiles][shapefile] into the services that power the geospatial search interface at the University of Virginia Library - [PostGIS][postgis], [Geoserver][geoserver], and [Solr][solr].

## Installation

For now, while things are still in development, install the gem by cloning this repository and using the [Jeweler][jeweler] rake task:

```
rake install
```
